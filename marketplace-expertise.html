            <p class="hero-desc">These are operating principles, not a framework. They come from watching what actually happens inside marketplaces after the early growth narrative fades and the real problems start.</p>

            <h2>Liquidity is the only thing that compounds</h2>

            <p>A marketplace without liquidity is just a listing page. Liquidity means a buyer can find what they want and a seller can sell within a reasonable window. Everything else — features, brand, content — is secondary until liquidity exists.</p>

            <p>Most marketplace problems that look like demand problems are actually liquidity problems. The buyers are there. They just can't find the right supply at the right time. Fix matching and density before spending on acquisition.</p>

            <h2>Incentives determine outcomes more than product design</h2>

            <p>If seller incentives are misaligned with platform goals, no amount of product work will fix it. Sellers optimize for what the platform rewards. If the platform rewards volume, sellers will flood it with low-quality listings. If the platform rewards margin, sellers will restrict supply to protect pricing.</p>

            <p>The best marketplace operators design incentive structures first and build product around them. Most do it the other way around, then wonder why seller behavior doesn't match the product vision.</p>

            <h2>Trust erodes quietly before growth slows</h2>

            <p>Trust is not a feature. It's the accumulated result of thousands of small interactions going right. And it decays silently. A buyer who gets a bad experience doesn't file a complaint — they just don't come back. A seller who feels the platform favors larger competitors doesn't announce their exit — they reduce inventory.</p>

            <p>By the time trust erosion shows up in metrics, it's already months old. The operators who catch it early are the ones measuring leading indicators: seller response times, dispute resolution rates, repeat purchase frequency, listing quality trends. Not GMV.</p>

            <h2>Supply quality matters more than supply quantity</h2>

            <p>The instinct in early marketplace building is to grow the number of sellers as fast as possible. More supply, more selection, more buyers. This works until it doesn't.</p>

            <p>Uncurated supply growth dilutes the marketplace. Search results degrade. Buyer confidence drops. The best sellers get buried under noise. The marketplace starts competing on price instead of quality, which attracts the wrong sellers and repels the right buyers. Curation is not a luxury. It's infrastructure.</p>

            <h2>Marketplaces fail through decay, not collapse</h2>

            <p>Marketplaces rarely die dramatically. They decay. Seller quality drifts. Buyer expectations outpace the experience. Operational costs increase while margins compress. Teams optimize for metrics that no longer reflect marketplace health.</p>

            <p>The hardest operational challenge in a marketplace is not getting to scale. It's maintaining quality at scale. The problems that matter most after growth are the ones nobody built dashboards for: incentive drift, category saturation, support load per transaction, and the slow erosion of what made the marketplace worth using in the first place.</p>

            <h2>Local context shapes behavior more than product does</h2>

            <p>The same marketplace model produces completely different outcomes in different markets. Payment preferences, trust thresholds, seller sophistication, logistics infrastructure, regulatory constraints — all of these vary enough to make a globally uniform product a liability.</p>

            <p>Operators who treat local context as an edge case will lose to operators who treat it as the primary design constraint. The product should adapt to the market. The market will not adapt to the product.</p>

            <h2>The metrics that matter change after scale</h2>

            <p>Early-stage marketplace metrics are about growth: GMV, seller count, buyer acquisition, conversion rate. These are necessary but become dangerous if they're the only lens after scale.</p>

            <p>Post-scale, the metrics that matter are about health: seller churn, listing quality, repeat purchase rate, support ticket volume per transaction, time-to-first-sale for new sellers, and the ratio of organic to paid demand. A marketplace can grow GMV while its foundation is deteriorating. The operators who understand this measure both.</p>

            <!-- Closing -->
            <p>This is the lens I use to evaluate and operate marketplaces. Not the growth playbook. Not the fundraising narrative. The operating reality of what makes a marketplace work — and what quietly breaks it.</p>

            <h1>Side Projects</h1>
            <p class="hero-desc">I build outside structured platforms as often as I build within them. Some of these projects became businesses. Some remained experiments. Some failed. All of them were built deliberately.</p>

            <h2>Evryfit and The Hoodel</h2>

            <p>Evryfit was a fitness-focused direct-to-consumer ecommerce brand. The Hoodel was a product I created from scratch, designed by me and taken through sourcing and manufacturing. This was not a white-label operation. It required direct product development, supply chain setup, and end-to-end execution from concept to market.</p>

            <p>The work involved identifying a gap in the fitness product space, designing a physical product, managing the manufacturing process, and building the ecommerce infrastructure to sell it. It was an exercise in product development discipline applied outside the software world.</p>

            <h2>Bathroom Planner Tool</h2>

            <p>Built while helping manage a family home construction project. Existing tools for tracking and selecting bathroom fittings and tiles were not practical for how the decisions actually needed to be made. I built a functional planner tool to solve the problem directly. It was a small, focused build driven by a real operational constraint.</p>

            <h2>Vintage Designer Resale</h2>

            <p>An attempt to build a resale model around vintage designer jewelry, including pieces from Chanel, Hermes, and YSL. The concept was sound, authenticated vintage luxury at accessible price points, sold through a curated online channel.</p>

            <p>It did not scale as expected. The structural misalignment between supply availability and consistent buyer demand made the model difficult to sustain. I treated it as a learning experiment and moved on.</p>

            <p>Not everything I build becomes a business. But the instinct to build, test, and learn from the result is consistent across all of it.</p>

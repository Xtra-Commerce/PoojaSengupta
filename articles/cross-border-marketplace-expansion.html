            <section id="section-1">
                <h2>Why Cross-Border Matters for Marketplaces</h2>
                <p>
                    Operating a marketplace in a single country limits your total addressable market and concentration risk. The US ecommerce market, while massive, is intensely competitive with dominant players like Amazon, eBay, and Walmart controlling significant share. Australia, while affluent, has limited scale with only 26 million people. India represents an enormous growth opportunity but different dynamics entirely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For Sengupta, the cross-border vision at PurvX emerged from recognizing that operating in a single market was insufficient to build a sustainable, global-scale business. The opportunity was to build a marketplace that could serve diaspora communities across the US and India while leveraging Australian expertise and operations.
                </p>

                <h3>Market Diversification and Risk Reduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Operating across multiple markets provides crucial diversification benefits. Economic downturns don't affect all markets simultaneously. Regulatory changes in one jurisdiction don't require global business model shifts. Competitor moves in one market don't determine your entire business trajectory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This diversification is particularly valuable for marketplace operators where network effects are geographically bound. A marketplace strong in the US might face competition from Amazon; a marketplace strong in India might face competition from Flipkart or Meesho. But a marketplace with strong presence across multiple geographies has multiple defensible positions.
                </p>

                <h3>Category and Supplier Advantages</h3>
                <p>
                    Different countries have different supplier ecosystems and category strengths. India has exceptional textile and handicraft production; the US has mature consumer electronics and home goods suppliers; Australia has unique local consumer goods and agricultural products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cross-border operations allow you to source the best-in-category products globally and serve them to the most receptive customer bases. This creates a flywheel: better products attract more sellers; more sellers attract more categories; more categories attract more customers.
                </p>

                <h3>Capital and Talent Efficiency</h3>
                <p>
                    Building a global presence through multiple independent companies is capital-intensive and operationally complex. Building a single global platform that serves multiple markets is more capital-efficient. Infrastructure, technology, and operational systems can be shared across markets, reducing duplication.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This efficiency manifests particularly in Sengupta's experience with GS1 work, where global data standards and interoperability frameworks reduced the overhead of operating across Amazon, Google, and Alibaba simultaneously. Rather than maintaining separate product data, pricing, and inventory systems for each platform, standardized data enabled efficient multi-platform operations.

            <!-- Key Takeaway Box -->
            <div class="key-takeaway">
                <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Cross-border marketplace expansion provides market diversification, access to diverse supplier ecosystems, and capital efficiency through shared infrastructure—but requires understanding fundamental differences across jurisdictions.
            </div>

            <!-- Section 2 -->
            <section id="section-2">
                <h2>Understanding Market Dynamics: US, Australia, and India</h2>
                <p>
                    The US, Australia, and India represent three dramatically different ecommerce environments. Success in one market doesn't automatically translate to success in another. Sengupta's experience operating across these markets reveals fundamental differences that shape marketplace strategy.
                </p>

                <h3>The United States Market</h3>
                <p>
                    The US represents the world's largest and most mature ecommerce market. With over 330 million people, high GDP per capita, and mature digital infrastructure, the US market is characterized by:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Intense Competition:</strong> Amazon dominates with 40%+ ecommerce share, Walmart, eBay, and countless vertical specialists create a highly competitive environment</li>
                    <li><strong>Sophisticated Consumers:</strong> US consumers are familiar with ecommerce and have high expectations for selection, price, and delivery speed</li>
                    <li><strong>Diverse Categories:</strong> Success requires competing across broad categories rather than specializing in narrow niches</li>
                    <li><strong>Fragmented Regulations:</strong> Federal trade law creates baseline requirements, but state-level regulations (sales tax, consumer protection) add complexity</li>
                    <li><strong>Complex Logistics:</strong> Geographic diversity requires sophisticated distribution and logistics networks to compete on delivery speed</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Competing in the US market requires either differentiation through unique product categories, exceptional service, or community focus—you're unlikely to outcompete Amazon on scale or breadth.
                </p>

                <h3>The Australian Market</h3>
                <p>
                    Australia presents a smaller, more concentrated, but high-value market. With 26 million people and high GDP per capita, Australia has unique dynamics:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Limited Scale:</strong> The total Australian ecommerce market is comparable to a mid-tier US city, limiting total opportunity but also limiting required scale</li>
                    <li><strong>High Consumer Spend:</strong> Australian consumers spend more per capita on ecommerce than most countries, creating premium positioning opportunity</li>
                    <li><strong>Import Dependency:</strong> Much product assortment requires importing or working with importers, creating friction but also differentiation opportunity</li>
                    <li><strong>Strong Incumbent Position:</strong> Coles, Woolworths, and local retailers have significant online presence; Amazon's Australia expansion is relatively recent</li>
                    <li><strong>Strong Consumer Protection:</strong> Australian consumer law provides strong protections that marketplace operators must respect</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The Australian market rewards focused operators with premium positioning, strong local relationships, and customer service excellence. Sengupta's experience at Coles and Catch demonstrates that success in Australia comes from deep local understanding and operational excellence rather than attempting to compete on pure scale.
                </p>

                <h3>The Indian Market</h3>
                <p>
                    India represents the world's fastest-growing ecommerce market but with fundamentally different dynamics than mature Western markets:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Explosive Growth:</strong> Indian ecommerce is growing at 20-30% annually, creating massive opportunity but also uncertainty</li>
                    <li><strong>First-Time Online Buyers:</strong> Large segments of Indian consumers are new to ecommerce, requiring education and trust-building</li>
                    <li><strong>Cash-Heavy Payments:</strong> While digital payments are growing, COD (Cash on Delivery) remains dominant, requiring different logistics and payment processing approaches</li>
                    <li><strong>Evolving Regulations:</strong> FDI restrictions, taxation, and data residency requirements are constantly evolving</li>
                    <li><strong>Local Competition:</strong> Flipkart and Amazon India dominate, but local competitors like Meesho are growing rapidly in specific categories</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    India's market dynamics are fundamentally different from developed markets. First-time online buyers have different expectations; payment systems are different; trust and local relationships matter more; regulatory certainty is lower. Sengupta's earlier experience in India as VP eCommerce at various startups (2010-2014) provided deep understanding of these dynamics.

                <h2>Building for Multiple Markets Simultaneously</h2>
                <p>
                    PurvX's strategy involved building a single platform that could serve the US market (San Francisco base) and Indian market (Chennai operations) simultaneously. This approach differs from building separate marketplaces for each country. The question becomes: how do you build a platform that accommodates substantial market differences while maintaining operational efficiency?
                </p>

                <h3>Architecture for Market Flexibility</h3>
                <p>
                    The foundational principle is separating core platform architecture from market-specific implementations. Core capabilities—seller management, order management, payment processing, reporting—should be implemented once and reused across markets. Market-specific implementations—regulatory compliance, localization, payment methods—should be configurable without rewriting core systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At PurvX, this meant building:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Multi-Currency Support:</strong> Underlying systems support multiple currencies with proper FX handling and settlement logic</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-Language Platform:</strong> Localization isn't just translation; it's cultural adaptation of the entire experience</li>
                    <li><strong>Pluggable Payment Processors:</strong> Payment processing adapts to market preferences rather than forcing one approach</li>
                    <li><strong>Configurable Regulatory Logic:</strong> Tax calculation, shipping rules, and compliance requirements are market-configurable</li>
                    <li><strong>Localized Seller Onboarding:</strong> Seller requirements, documentation, and incentives vary by market</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Shared Operations with Market Teams</h3>
                <p>
                    While the platform can be shared, operations require market expertise. Sengupta's approach involved maintaining dedicated market teams (US-based for the US; India-based for India) who understood local dynamics while working within a shared platform and operational framework.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The shared platform meant that infrastructure investments, technology decisions, and process improvements benefited all markets. A better recommendation algorithm developed for the US market could be deployed to India. An improved seller dashboard in the US could be localized and deployed in India.
                </p>

                <h3>Product and Category Strategy Across Markets</h3>
                <p>
                    Category strategy must vary by market. A category successful in the US might not exist or have different dynamics in India. Product sourcing, pricing, and positioning need market-specific strategies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sengupta's approach involved focusing the platform on categories with cross-border opportunity—particularly goods that appeal to diaspora communities and transcend geographic boundaries. Rather than attempting to be everything in both markets, PurvX focused on categories where the platform could offer unique value.
                </p>

                <h3>Investment Prioritization</h3>
                <p>
                    Building globally requires making difficult investment priority decisions. Should you invest in features for market A or market B? How do you allocate product development resources across markets with different maturity levels and growth rates?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sengupta's framework involved evaluating investments by their impact on the global platform value, not just individual market value. An investment that serves both markets is more justified than an investment serving only one. Investments that improve core platform efficiency benefit all markets more than investments in market-specific features.
                </p>

                <h2>Payments and Currency Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                    Cross-border operations require solving currency and payment challenges that single-market operations never face. These challenges extend beyond simply accepting multiple payment methods—they touch pricing, settlement, FX exposure, and customer experience.
                </p>

                <h3>Market-Specific Payment Preferences</h3>
                <p>
                    Payment method preferences vary dramatically across markets. In the United States, credit and debit cards dominate ecommerce transactions. Visa and Mastercard are ubiquitous, and consumers expect card-based checkout. American Express is also widely accepted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Australia has more diverse payment preferences. While cards remain important, digital wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay), bank transfers, and BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later) services are increasingly popular. Sengupta's experience at Catch revealed that Australian consumers often prefer direct bank transfer or BNPL options over cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    India's payment landscape is fundamentally different. Cash on Delivery (COD) remains the dominant payment method for first-time online buyers. For repeat customers and those with digital payment adoption, UPI (Unified Payments Interface), wallet services (Paytm, Google Pay), and NEFT bank transfers are popular. Credit card penetration is relatively low.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At PurvX, supporting all three markets meant integrating payment processors that could handle this diversity. Stripe and PayPal support cards globally; Razorpay supports Indian payment methods; local processors were necessary for specialized approaches like COD.
                </p>

                <h3>Currency Management and Pricing Strategy</h3>
                <p>
                    Operating in multiple currencies requires deciding how to display and charge customers. Do you show prices in the local currency of each market? Do you charge customers in their local currency and handle FX conversion yourself? Do you require customers to pay in a single global currency?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sengupta's approach at PurvX involved offering transparent local currency pricing. A customer in India sees prices in INR; a customer in the US sees prices in USD. This improves customer experience by eliminating conversion confusion. The trade-off is that the platform must handle currency conversion and FX exposure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This approach requires deciding how to price products across markets. The same product might have different prices in USD and INR based on market dynamics, competition, and acquisition costs. Maintaining price consistency while accounting for FX creates complexity but provides better customer experience than forcing global pricing.
                </p>

                <h3>Foreign Exchange Risk Management</h3>
                <p>
                    When you operate in multiple currencies, you face FX exposure. If you sell a product for 100 INR to an Indian customer and pay a supplier in USD, you're exposed to INR/USD currency fluctuations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sengupta's approach involved using natural hedging where possible—matching customer payments in INR with INR-denominated supplier payments. Where natural hedging isn't possible, selective currency hedging through financial instruments managed FX risk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This FX management is particularly important for marketplaces where margins are tight. A 10% FX movement can turn a profitable category into a loss-making one. Hedging has costs, but it provides pricing stability and reduces volatility.
                </p>

                <h3>Settlements and Cross-Border Payouts</h3>
                <p>
                    In a marketplace, sellers need to receive payments for their sales. When sellers are in different countries than the platform operator, international wire transfers and currency conversion become necessary. These transfers are expensive, slow, and involve compliance requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At PurvX, the approach involved using platforms like Wise (formerly TransferWise) and PayPal for efficient cross-border payouts. Rather than traditional bank wires (slow, expensive, with many fees), these platforms offer faster, cheaper cross-border transfers. For sellers in India receiving USD payments, platforms like Razorpay and Instamojo provide local INR payouts at reasonable rates.
                </p>

                <h2>Regulatory and Compliance Considerations</h2>
                <p>
                    Operating across multiple jurisdictions multiplies regulatory complexity. Each country has its own tax laws, consumer protection requirements, product safety standards, and data protection regulations. Sengupta's experience with GS1 global standards work highlighted how critical compliance is for international operations.
                </p>

                <h3>Sales Tax and VAT Obligations</h3>
                <p>
                    The United States has complex, fragmented sales tax requirements. Physical presence in a state triggers sales tax collection obligations. Economic nexus rules (post-South Dakota v. Wayfair) require collecting sales tax even without physical presence. Tax rates vary by state and even by locality. Product categories are taxed differently in different states.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Australia has a more straightforward system. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a unified 10% tax on most goods. International sellers must register for GST if their turnover exceeds thresholds. The system is simpler than the US but still requires careful management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    India has a complex Goods and Services Tax (GST) system with multiple tax tiers (5%, 12%, 18%, 28%) depending on product category. Compliance is mandatory even for foreign sellers above certain thresholds. The system is more centralized than the US but has state-level variations. Importantly, foreign sellers face additional FDI and foreign ownership restrictions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At PurvX, this meant building tax compliance systems that calculated correct sales tax/GST for each transaction based on customer location, product category, and seller location. This required integrating with tax compliance platforms and maintaining detailed audit trails.
                </p>

                <h3>Consumer Protection and Warranty Laws</h3>
                <p>
                    Consumer protection laws vary significantly. The US has the FTC Act and various state consumer protection laws. Australia has exceptionally strong consumer protection laws requiring refunds for unsuitable goods and warranties for faulty goods. India has the Consumer Protection Act with protections for online buyers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These different frameworks meant that PurvX's return and refund policies had to be market-specific. Australian consumer law forced more generous return policies than would otherwise be offered. US law allowed stricter return policies. Indian law required specific consumer protection disclosures.
                </p>

                <h3>Data Privacy and Protection Regulations</h3>
                <p>
                    The EU's GDPR is the gold standard for data protection. Australia's Privacy Act is similarly comprehensive. The US has sector-specific privacy laws but no comprehensive federal privacy law. India's data protection framework is still evolving but increasingly strict on data localization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a marketplace collecting customer data across multiple countries, this created complex requirements:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Localization:</strong> India increasingly requires personal data to be stored locally, complicating infrastructure for platforms trying to maintain unified systems</li>
                    <li><strong>Consent and Privacy:</strong> GDPR-equivalent requirements in Australia require explicit consent for data processing; the US has fewer requirements</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Transfer Restrictions:</strong> Some countries restrict transferring personal data internationally, complicating unified platform operations</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Product Safety and Standards</h3>
                <p>
                    Different countries have different product safety standards and regulatory requirements. Electronics sold in the US must meet FCC standards; in Australia, they must meet ACMA standards; in India, they must meet BIS standards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a marketplace selling products internationally, ensuring products meet all applicable standards in their destination market is crucial. This requires coordination with sellers and product verification processes.
                </p>

                <h3>Building Compliance Infrastructure</h3>
                <p>
                    Managing compliance across three jurisdictions requires building robust compliance infrastructure. This includes tax calculation systems, consumer protection workflows, data protection safeguards, and product verification processes. Rather than relying on legal interpretations of complex regulations, Sengupta's approach involved:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Working with local legal counsel in each market to understand specific obligations</li>
                    <li>Building compliance requirements into the platform architecture from the beginning rather than retrofitting them</li>
                    <li>Creating market-specific workflows that ensure compliance without creating excessive friction</li>
                    <li>Maintaining audit trails and documentation for compliance verification</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <!-- Key Takeaway Box 2 -->
            <div class="key-takeaway">
                <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Cross-border expansion requires managing fundamentally different regulatory frameworks, payment systems, and compliance obligations. Success comes from building flexibility into platform architecture while maintaining operational consistency.

            <!-- Section 6 -->
            <section id="section-6">
                <h2>Cultural Context in Marketplace Design</h2>
                <p>
                    Beyond regulatory and payment differences, cultural context shapes how customers interact with marketplaces. What works in the US doesn't automatically work in India or Australia. Successful cross-border expansion requires cultural understanding, not just technical localization.
                </p>

                <h3>Trust and Credibility Signals</h3>
                <p>
                    Different cultures have different trust signals. In the US, customer reviews and ratings are powerful trust signals. Customers assume that large corporations won't defraud them and that the platform will handle disputes. Trust is relatively abstract.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In India, trust is more personal and relationship-based. Customers trust established brands and recommendations from known sources. Stranger reviews are less trusted. Seller verification, brand recognition, and local presence matter more. At PurvX, this meant emphasizing seller verification, brand partnerships, and local language support more than in the US marketplace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Australia, trust comes from established reputation, transparent business practices, and strong customer service. The combination of high consumer protection laws and high consumer expectations means that trust is based on demonstrated ethical business practices.
                </p>

                <h3>Localization vs. Standardization Trade-offs</h3>
                <p>
                    Complete localization (building different interfaces for each market) is expensive and hard to maintain. Complete standardization (same interface everywhere) reduces development cost but doesn't adapt to local contexts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sengupta's approach at PurvX involved strategic localization—maintaining consistent core user flows while adapting elements that matter culturally:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Language and Content:</strong> Full localization into local languages; more than translation—cultural adaptation</li>
                    <li><strong>Payment Workflows:</strong> Different payment methods displayed based on market (COD prominent in India; cards prominent in US)</li>
                    <li><strong>Product Information:</strong> Localized product descriptions adapting to local regulations and consumer preferences</li>
                    <li><strong>Customer Service:</strong> Local support teams available in local languages during local business hours</li>
                    <li><strong>Visual Design:</strong> Limited customization—core design remained consistent but color choices, imagery, and visual hierarchy adapted to market preferences</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>South Asian Diaspora Focus</h3>
                <p>
                    PurvX's particular focus on South Asian diaspora communities represents a specific cultural strategy. Rather than attempting to serve all customers in each market, the marketplace could focus on categories and products particularly valued by diaspora communities:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Indian groceries, spices, and specialty foods for Indians in the US</li>
                    <li>Australian consumer goods and luxury items for Australians and Western expats in India</li>
                    <li>Indian artisanal products and handicrafts appealing to global audiences</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This diaspora focus creates a community identity while solving a real customer need—diaspora customers want authentic products from their home country, and diaspora communities have established trust networks that can be leveraged for marketplace growth.
                </p>

                <h3>Religious and Cultural Sensitivities</h3>
                <p>
                    India has strong cultural and religious sensitivities that must be respected in marketplace operations. This includes sensitive categories like beef (culturally sensitive in Hindu-dominant India) and halal certification for Muslim consumers. Imagery and language must be culturally appropriate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Australia and the US have different sensitivities but still require cultural awareness. Representation in imagery, inclusive language, and respect for different community backgrounds matter for customer trust.
                </p>
            </section>

            <!-- Section 7 -->
            <section id="section-7">
                <h2>Data Interoperability Across Borders</h2>
                <p>
                    Sengupta's work with GS1 (Global Standards One) provides crucial perspective on data interoperability across borders. In a cross-border marketplace context, data quality and standardization become essential infrastructure that enable efficient operations.
                </p>

                <h3>Product Data Standardization</h3>
                <p>
                    GS1 standards provide a global framework for product identification and description. The Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) provides a unique, globally recognized product identifier. GS1 product information standards ensure that product descriptions are structured consistently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a cross-border marketplace, this standardization is invaluable. Instead of each seller describing products in idiosyncratic formats, GS1 standards ensure that product information is consistent, machine-readable, and compatible with major platforms like Amazon, Google Shopping, and Alibaba.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At PurvX, using GS1 standards meant that product information could be efficiently syndicated across multiple sales channels. Products added to the marketplace with GS1-compliant data could be easily listed on other platforms without reformatting.
                </p>

                <h3>Regulatory Data Requirements</h3>
                <p>
                    Different countries require different product information for regulatory compliance. Australia requires country of origin labeling; India requires manufacturer details and import information; the US has various requirements depending on product category.
                </p>
                <p>
                    GS1 standards can be extended to capture market-specific regulatory requirements. Rather than maintaining separate data schemas for each market, you can maintain a unified schema that includes both global GS1 elements and market-specific extensions.
                </p>

                <h3>Multi-Platform Syndication</h3>
                <p>
                    Operating across multiple platforms (marketplace website, Amazon, Google Shopping, social commerce) requires efficient product data syndication. Without standardized data, keeping product information synchronized across multiple platforms becomes a manual, error-prone process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sengupta's experience with GS1 standards for global platforms (Amazon, Google, Alibaba) revealed that platforms increasingly require or expect GS1-compliant product data. Sellers using GS1 standards have easier onboarding, better searchability, and better compatibility with platform features.
                </p>

                <h3>Building a Master Data Management System</h3>
                <p>
                    For a cross-border marketplace, implementing a master data management (MDM) system is crucial. This system maintains the authoritative product information that is syndicated to all channels and markets. Rather than having product information scattered across different systems, a central MDM system provides a single source of truth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The MDM system should:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Support GS1 standards for product identification and core attributes</li>
                    <li>Include market-specific attribute requirements for each jurisdiction</li>
                    <li>Provide versioning and audit trails for compliance</li>
                    <li>Enable efficient syndication to multiple sales channels</li>
                    <li>Support workflow for data validation and enrichment</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Seller Education on Data Quality</h3>
                <p>
                    Even with standardized requirements, seller discipline is crucial. Sellers must provide complete, accurate product information in the required format. This requires ongoing education and support.

                    Sengupta's approach involved building seller tools that made compliance easy—templates for product information, validation that caught data quality issues before products were live, and guided workflows that prevented common mistakes. By making compliance the path of least resistance, data quality improves naturally.

                    <h3>What are the major differences between marketplace opportunities in the US, Australia, and India?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The US market is highly mature with significant competition (Amazon dominates) but massive scale ($600B+ annually). Australia is smaller ($20-25B) but concentrated and affluent with high consumer spending per capita. India is rapidly growing (20-30% annually) but with fundamentally different payment preferences (COD-dominant), regulatory landscape, and consumer behavior. Market maturity, competition intensity, regulatory complexity, and payment infrastructure differ substantially. Sengupta's approach involves tailoring marketplace strategy to market-specific dynamics rather than assuming the same model works everywhere.

                    <h3>How do you handle cross-border payments and currency management?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Cross-border payments require working with payment processors that support multi-currency settlement, managing FX exposure through hedging or natural hedging, and understanding different payment method preferences across markets. In the US, credit cards dominate; in Australia, digital wallets and bank transfers are increasingly popular; in India, UPI and wallet-based payments are preferred. At PurvX, Sengupta's approach involved selecting payment partners with strong presence across all three markets while managing currency risk through a combination of natural hedging (matching currency-denominated receivables with payables) and selective financial hedging.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What are the key regulatory compliance challenges in cross-border operations?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Regulatory complexity increases significantly with each new market. Tax obligations, consumer protection laws, product safety requirements, and data privacy regulations differ across jurisdictions. The US has fragmented state-level tax requirements; Australia has strong consumer protection and data privacy laws; India has evolving regulations on foreign ownership and FDI restrictions. Sengupta's approach involves building compliance programs that understand and satisfy market-specific requirements while maintaining consistent core operations through configurable systems and local legal partnerships.

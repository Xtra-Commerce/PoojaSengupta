                    <h1>About Pooja</h1>
                    <p>Pooja started her career in financial services at Citibank UK, working in the credit cards division before relocating to Australia. She worked as a Web Solutions Consultant at Melbourne IT and later as a Marketing Analyst at Zoho, building expertise in digital marketing and product strategy.</p>

                    <p>Born from a fashion blog, The Lust List, Dropped Pin sourced high-street international labels from the US, UK, and Europe for the Indian market. The platform earned coverage in The Economic Times and The Indian Express.</p>

                    <p>Pooja's next chapter took her into enterprise-scale ecommerce operations. She joined Catch.com.au as Head of Merchandising, where she managed a $200M P&L and drove category strategies with 40%+ margins. She later stepped into one of Australia's most challenging retail transformation roles: at Coles Supermarket, she led the Head of Online Merchandising & Strategic Partnerships function, overseeing a $1.1B P&L across 800+ storefronts. In this role, she commanded a cross-functional team of 20+ professionals spanning product, business analysis, merchandising, range management, and business development, while coordinating with IT, Finance, store operations, and offshore consulting partners. Under her leadership, Coles launched groundbreaking initiatives including the world's first grocery marketplace on eBay and integrated logistics partnerships with UberEats, Airtasker, and Deliveroo, achieving 35% delivery cost reductions.</p>

                    <p>Her expertise in data standards and platform ecosystems deepened during her tenure at GS1 Australia, where she served as Account Director for eCommerce & Marketplaces, working across Amazon, Google, and Alibaba with a portfolio of 300+ brands. She brought these insights to Lasoo.com.au as Head of Marketplace, where she transformed a catalogue business into a dynamic marketplace on Marketplacer, scaling to 60+ retailers with 120% month-on-month GMV growth and driving 15% revenue uplift through retail media initiatives.</p>

                    <p>Today, Pooja is the Founder and Head of Product and Growth at PurvX, a circular marketplace focused on sustainable South Asian fashion with operations in San Francisco and Chennai. The platform has achieved 800% user growth and 3.2x seller conversion in its first year.</p>

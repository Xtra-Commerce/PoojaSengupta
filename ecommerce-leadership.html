            <h1>Ecommerce &amp; Marketplace Leadership</h1>
            <p class="hero-desc">Operating experience across ecommerce and marketplace businesses in the US, India, and Australia, including senior leadership within Fortune 500 companies and P&L ownership at scale.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="wrap--narrow">

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Enterprise Ecommerce Leadership</h2>
            <p>Fortune 500 ecommerce at scale means owning outcomes across revenue, margin, operations, and customer experience. All happen simultaneously. I've held direct P&L responsibility for large ecommerce businesses, including a $1.1B online retail operation across 800+ storefronts and a $200M cross-category marketplace.</p>
            <p>Enterprise ecommerce also means omnichannel. The online business doesn't exist independently of stores, supply chain, or brand. Online orders were fulfilled from stores, dark stores, and third-party partners, each with different cost structures, staffing models, and customer experience implications. Managing this required constant negotiation between digital priorities and physical retail realities.</p>
            <p>The scale also shapes what matters operationally. Managing 800+ digital storefronts requires systematic approaches to ranging, promotion, pricing, and content that cannot be executed manually. Technology and data automation become essential infrastructure, not optional enhancements.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Marketplace &amp; Commercial Operations</h2>
            <p>I've operated marketplace businesses where margin, inventory, and seller quality are managed simultaneously. Not theoretically, but daily.</p>
            <p>On the Mirakl platform, I ran a $200M P&L with accountability for gross margin (sustained at 40%+), inventory turns (DOH under 45 days), and conversion (18% uplift through UX and merchandising improvements). Weekly promotional cycles were the core revenue driver, requiring synchronized execution across pricing, creative production, email, social, and warehouse teams every week.</p>
            <p>Marketplace performance was measured weekly across GMV, margin, inventory turns, conversion, and seller health, with decisions creating second-order effects across supply, demand, trust, and operations. Post-scale, the hardest problems were no longer growth but decay: seller quality, incentive misalignment, operational bottlenecks, and trust erosion.</p>
            <p>Commercial accountability also extended to strategic partnerships. I led the launch of a grocery marketplace on eBay, a multimillion-dollar initiative that expanded addressable market and brought incremental revenue, while navigating integration complexity, fulfillment model decisions, and commission economics. Last-mile delivery partnerships with providers including UberEATS, Airtasker, and Deliveroo reduced average delivery time by 35% while optimizing fulfillment costs across the network.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Cross-Functional Leadership</h2>
            <p>I've led large teams spanning product management, merchandising, business analysis, ranging, and business development, including significant offshore teams. The work isn't delegation. It's aligning incentives across functions that naturally optimize for different metrics, making trade-offs visible, and holding people accountable to business outcomes rather than functional outputs.</p>
            <p>At Fortune 500 scale, this means managing relationships with IT, finance, store operations, logistics, and marketing, each with their own priorities and constraints. The leadership challenge is making decisions that account for all of them without being paralyzed by the coordination cost.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Platforms, Data &amp; Infrastructure</h2>
            <p>I've operated on the Mirakl marketplace platform and worked directly with GS1 data standards across major retailers, marketplaces, and suppliers, including Amazon, Google, and Alibaba.</p>
            <p>Standards and shared infrastructure reduced friction across complex commerce ecosystems and enabled scale without proportional increases in operational overhead. Standardized product data enables inventory accuracy, catalog consistency across channels, and integration with third-party marketplaces. Without it, every new channel or partnership becomes a custom integration project.</p>
            <p>At GS1, I managed relationships with 300+ brands and major platforms, advancing standards adoption across the ecosystem. The businesses that invest in data infrastructure early compound their advantage over time. The ones that don't spend disproportionate effort on integration, reconciliation, and error correction.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>Founder Execution</h2>
            <p>Evryfit is a direct-to-consumer fitness brand I built from scratch: product ideation, design, and manufacturing, all led by me. This wasn't a marketplace play or a platform bet. It was physical product development: identifying a gap, designing products, managing manufacturing, and bringing them to market.</p>
            <p>Dropped Pin was earlier ecommerce execution, building a commerce platform before the current generation of tools made it straightforward. Both ventures required the same discipline as enterprise operations: understanding unit economics, managing supply chains, and making decisions with limited resources and no safety net.</p>
            <p>The difference between operating at Fortune 500 scale and building at zero is not the skills required. It's the margin for error. Founder work strips away organizational support structures and forces clarity about what actually matters.</p>
